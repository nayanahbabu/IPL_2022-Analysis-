<h1>IPL 2022 Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization </h1><br>
This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization on the IPL 2022 dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about matches, players, teams, and various statistics related to the Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket tournament.<br>

<h3>Dataset</h3>
The dataset used in this project IPL 2022.csv is sourced from Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aravindas01/ipl-2022dataset] and contains the following:<br>

match_id,	date,	venue,	team1,	team2,	stage,	toss_winner,	toss_decision,	first_ings_score,	first_ings_wkts,	second_ings_score,	second_ings_wkts,	match_winner,	won_by,	margin,	player_of_the_match,	top_scorer,	highscore,	best_bowling,	best_bowling_figure.<br>
The dataset is cleaned and prepared using the Pandas library to ensure data quality and consistency before performing analysis and visualization.<br>

<h3>Tools and Libraries Used</h3><br>
The project utilizes the following tools and Python libraries:<br>

Pandas: For data manipulation, cleaning, and preparation.<br>
Matplotlib: For creating basic plots and visualizations.<br>
Seaborn: For creating more advanced statistical visualizations.<br>
Plotly: For interactive and dynamic visualizations.<br>

<h3>Analysis and Visualization</h3><br>
The project includes iplanalysis.ipynb file and scripts for performing different aspects of EDA and visualization, including:<br>

Data Cleaning: Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers.<br>
Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzing key statistics and trends in the IPL dataset, such as match outcomes, player performance, team standings, etc.<br>
Visualizations: Creating visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to explore patterns, relationships, and insights within the data.<br>

<h3>Usage</h3><br>
To run the notebooks and scripts in this project, follow these steps:<br>

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.<br>
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.<br>
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts using your preferred IDE or Jupyter Notebook.<br>
